# AI-ML: "Scientific AI" Workload

## Purpose and Description

The purpose of this benchmark is to capture a 'typical scientific AI' workload performed by researchers at NREL, in which image segmentation tasks are common for various scientific purposes. As such, we employ a DeepCAM model training implementation from MLCommons ([example reference here](https://github.com/mlcommons/hpc_results_v3.0/tree/main/NVIDIA/benchmarks/deepcam/implementations/pytorch)) to segment climate data from HDF5-formatted files. 

This page is being actively developed and will be updated with more detailed instructions in the near future.
